Hi everyone my name is Hridhan Dawar and welcome to my website that I used html to code. It was really fun to make this website so I hope you like it! In this page I shall tell you general things about myself. In the second tab you will be able to find my interests and in the third tab you will be able to see what i would like to be when I grow up. I was born in Max hospital New Delhi on 20th January,2011 growing up I always had a knack at studies, especially maths. Around the age of 5 my mother enrolled me in Kumon so I could improve my maths. I still go to kumon nowadays! Anyways after that I never got less than a A+ in maths or in any other subject. . After coming to 4th grade my,grandfather had an accident and he broke his leg. He was a very active man for his age and he didn't like being confined to the house. The next year when I was in 5th grade the Pandemic broke out and online classes were started by the school. It felt amazing chatting with friends in between classes and not having to go to school. But when 2021 came and the pandemic was continuing I badly wanted to get out of the house and meet my friends in person. But in April my whole family, excluding me and my brother got covid. After a long battle against it my grandfather expired. When schools reopened I was... well so happy I cant express it here. 2022 was a great year for me looking forward to a great 2023!
