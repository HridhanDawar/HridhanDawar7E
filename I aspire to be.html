Hello there! Welcome to the last page of my website I hope you liked it until now! Anyways, when I grow older
I would like to be a astronaut, cricketer, youtuber and chef. A lot of things! You might be
thinking, how could I be so many things at once? Well, the truth is that I haven't really decided what I would like to be.
I would like to be a chef as I am a huge foodie and I would like to cook great food for myself and other people.
I would like to be an astronaut because I would like to experience 0 gravity and see the different sights in space.
I would like to be a youtube as I love video games and would like to show other people my skills.
I would like to become a cricketer because....I like cricket. :)
