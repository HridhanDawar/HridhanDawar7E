Hi! In this tab you can find out about my interests. My hobbies are cricket, swimming and playing basketball. I also like to read, listen to music and play video games. When I was 3 my Nanu got me a ipad. I downloaded many games such as Temple Run and Subway Surfers (I hope that's not copyright) Nowadays I like to play Call of Duty games. I have always been an avid reader I started reading novels around the age of 6 and I still love reading. When I was 6 my father got me novel by the writer Endid Blyton. I read it in a week's time and its been a long journey since then! I have always been a fan of cricket especially because my father and grandfather were into cricket. I remember cheering for Dhoni when I was just 4 or 5. These are my Interests and if you want to find out more about me, just click on the 3rd button. I will see you there!
